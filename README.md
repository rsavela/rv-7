# RV-7
RV-7 Builder's Log

## Introduction

After 10 years or so of thinking about building an airplane, on XX November, 2022, I finally ordered the empenage kit for an RV-7 from Van's.  Building in my two car garage.  I chose the RV, specifically the RV-7, because there are enough of them flying that I think I'm likely to complete the project.  It also has the range, speed and useful load to cover most of the flying trips I take.

## Goals

The goal is to complete the aircraft before I turn 50, or about six years from now.  I decided on the RV-7 because I have more tailwheel landings than tricycle, and I like how they look more.  The plan is for Garmin G3x touch avionics (unless Garmin releases something better before I buy them), a Lycoming 180hp engine and constant speed prop.

## Why host this on Github?

I'm familiar with it, and it is free.
